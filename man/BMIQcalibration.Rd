ORIGINAL AUTHOR: Andrew Teschendorff
The original BMIQ function from Teschendorff 2013 adjusts for the
type-2 bias in Illumina Infinium 450k data.
Later functions and edits were provided by yours truly, Steve Horvath.
I changed the code so that one can calibrate methylation data to a gold standard.
Specifically, I took version v_1.2 by Teschendorff  and fixed minor issues.
Also I made the code more robust e.g. by changing the optimization algorithm.
Toward this end, I used the method="Nelder-Mead" in optim()

Later functions and edits by Steve Horvath
Steve Horvath took version v_1.2 by Teschendorff
and fixed minor errors. Also he made the code more robust.
Importantly, SH changed the optimization algorithm to make it more robust.
SH used method="Nelder-Mead" in optim() since the other optimization method
sometimes gets stuck. Toward this end, the function blc was replaced by blc2.
